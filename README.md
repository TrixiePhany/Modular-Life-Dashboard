# React + Vite + TailwindCSS

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Pastel Plans
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, So my name is _Trixie_,
And this Pastel Plans was created as a little cozy corner of the internet something to showcase the kind of things I love to build. This is one of my full-stack application build with MongooseDB, I wanted to keep it simple and Pink! ðŸŒ¸ Itâ€™s more than just something my code, itâ€™s a space filled with tiny bits of self-care and creative organization, wrapped in soft pastel colors (we girl developers love these colours ðŸ©·)!

This is what my website looks like with simple and protected functionalities, and I really hope it is a candy to your eyes too. If you are wondering how did I implement the backgrounds, I used Canva for _Kuromi Sticker_ edits for the site, and rest fonts are from Google fonts. You will get my font links in the asset folder of my Repository.

From habit tracking, to daily affirmations, to skincare logs and to-dos every part of this project was built with the idea of calmness and clarity in mind. It also has a lot of features such as filtering, adding widgets and animation features and using React which means obviously it is responsive. You can clone this project from this Repository. Feel free to make changes and edits of your own to the project as To-Do apps are one of the best ways to show case your building skills as always. Similarly, so is my work.


I wanted to add a journaling space too, but truthfully, I ran out of ideas (and maybe a little bit of time). So, that part stayed a little unfinished. And that is okay because not everything has to be perfect to be meaningful. Maybe you can finish the unfinished task better than what i could do

Thank you for visiting. I hope you find something here that feels a little helpful or maybe even a little like home. 
### Happy Coding, Bubyeee!!
