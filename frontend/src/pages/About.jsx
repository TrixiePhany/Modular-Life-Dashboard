        So my name is Trixie, and this Pastel Plans was created as a little cozy corner of the internet something to showcase the kind of things I love to build. 
        This is one of my full-stack application build with MongooseDB, I wanted to keep it simple and Pink! ðŸŒ¸        
        Itâ€™s more than just something my code, itâ€™s a space filled with tiny bits of self-care and creative organization, wrapped in soft pastel colors (we girl developers love these colours ðŸ©·)!

        From habit tracking, to daily affirmations, to skincare logs and to-dos every part of this project was built with the idea of calmness and clarity in mind. 
        It also has a lot of features such as filtering, adding widgets and animation features and using React which means obviously it is responsive.
        You can clone this project as it will be available on my Github Repository. Feel free to make changes and edits of your own to the project as To-Do apps are one of the best 
        ways to show case your building skills as always. Similarly, so is my work.

        I wanted to add a journaling space too, but truthfully, I ran out of ideas (and maybe a little bit of time). So, that part stayed a little unfinished. And that is okay because not everything has to be perfect to be meaningful.
        Maybe you can finish the unfinished task better than what i could do
